Project Overview 


### Detailed Search Requirements for Course Data

1. Users can search course data by keywords and phrases extracted from course titles and descriptions.

2. Users can filter course data based on course duration, ratings, and rating count.

3. Users can facet course data by source (Microsoft, Udacity, Internal), course type (Module, Nanodegree, Internal), and role.

4. Users can sort course data results by fields such as title, level, technology, role, popularity, rating, and duration.

5. Users can view instructor profiles in the search results for internal courses.

6. Users can search for courses based on technology topics covered.

7. Users can access the URL of the course directly from the search results.

8. Users can view and filter internal course reviews within search results.

### Detailed Search Requirements for Curated Library

1. Users can search within curated PDF articles using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for keywords and phrases.

2. Users can search the curated library by author names and their associated institutions.

3. Users can filter search results in the curated library by publication name, publisher, and publication date.

4. Users can access the DOI URL for each article directly from the search results.

### Data Enrichment Requirements

1. Course data should include AI-enriched information, such as inferred skills from course descriptions.

2. Curated library articles should be enriched with metadata extraction for elements like author names, institutions, publication name, and dates.

### Additional Functional Requirements

1. The search solution should provide a user-friendly interface for complex queries, allowing combinations of filters and facets.

2. The system should ensure high-performance search capabilities, even with a large dataset.

3. The interface should be intuitive and accessible, catering to a diverse range of technical skill levels among users.

4. Search results should be presented in a clear, concise manner, highlighting key information for quick scanning by users.

5. There should be an option for users to provide feedback on the relevance and quality of search results.

6. Ensure data privacy and security, especially for internal course data and user interactions with the system.
